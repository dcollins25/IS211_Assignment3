This script should run as planned ...
	- use argparse module, requiring a URL as first position argument
	- create a method to download the data
	- use the method to retrieve the data from the URL passed on command-line
	- decode into UTF-8
	- put it into a dictionary
	- use the re module to process the data, working out image counts and browser top usage

	- Extra Credit: attempt to use datetime import time to process # of hits per hour (failed)
